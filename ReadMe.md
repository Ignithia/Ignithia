# Ello there, I'm Ignithia / Ryan! 

Welcome to my castle in GitHub! I'm a Front-End developer/Visual Designer who thrives on turning ideas into reality through code. Whether it’s crafting interactive experiences, diving into basic game mechanics, or exploring the depths of digital design. I’m all about creating something meaningful and fun.
## A Little About Me

  ### Passion Projects: 
  I’m currently working on 3D UI with A-Frame to further enhance my portfolio's experience. I'm also gamifying my portfolio with P5.js all the while working on college projects.  
  ### Skills I Love Using: 
  JavaScript, p5.js, HTML/CSS.  
  ### Learning: 
  Always experimenting with creative aspects despite not being very creative. I learn by creating and struggling, that's the joy of this field.
  ### Goal:
  I want to create something where I can say confidently that I am proud of creating it, while it's also beneficial to other people and not purely myself.
## Beyond Code
When I’m not coding, you’ll find me reading, boxing or gaming.  
  I'm not a fan of normal literature so you will find me reading manga/manhwa/manhua.  
    For boxing I don't do it profesionally only to keep myself fit and release stress in a healthier way.
